Creating an Remote Control car for my embedded system design class

The system described in this report is a remote-control car that uses Bluetooth communication to wirelessly transmit movement commands. A joystick module connected to an MSPM0G3507 microcontroller reads user input and sends joystick values via an HM-10 Bluetooth module. These values are transmitted over UART to an Arduino on the car side. The Arduino receives the joystick data through its own HM-10 Bluetooth module and uses the information to control the car’s motors. An L298N motor driver module is connected between the Arduino and the car's DC motors, enabling the Arduino to control both motor speed and direction. The car can move in multiple directions, including forward, backward, left, and right, based on joystick inputs. The system consists of two main components: the controller unit based around the MSPM0G3507, and the car unit based around the Arduino Uno. This setup allows for simple and responsive remote control of the car using Bluetooth communication.

The hardware for this system includes a MSPM0G3507 connected to a HM-10 Bluetooth module using UART communication protocol, and a 2-axis potentiometer joystick module that is connected with a built-in ADC module. There is also a Arduino connected to a L298-N motor driver and another HM-10 Bluetooth module also connected with UART. The motor driver module control the input and output values for the two DC motors used in this project. This is all connected to a battery pack that makes 6V from 4 AA batteries.

The software for this system was written in C, and conforms to the flowcharts shown below. The setup function of the arduino code begins by opening a serial port and a Bluetooth port for UArt transmissions. The pin directions for the motor drivers are set to outputs, and the ENA and ENB are set to high to set speed to max. In the loop functions, the code is reading from the Bluetooth serial port into a character variable, and based on the value read enacts one of the predefined processes for moving the car. For the MSPM0 code, it begins by defining a function to send AT commands through UART. It then enables interupts for both the ADC and the UART used in this portion of the project.  It sends the command that connects to the HM-10 module on the Arduino and then enters a loop that reads from the ADC the value that the joystcik is out, and depending on the value for the certain axis, it sets the “sendAscii” variabe to different value then transmits that value over UART to the Bluetooth module.

The system begins by sending a At command to connect the two Bluetooth modules, and then the joystick that is attached to the MSPM0 has its data read via the ADC and based on the value read, certain values get sent over to move the car. When the joystick is moved straight up, both wheels spin forward, when the joystick is brough back bot wheels spin backward, when the joystick is moved left, the right wheel activates while the left says stationary to turn the car, and likewise for the right side. When the joystick is in the middle or not activated, the car stays still because of the stop command in the code.

There is a lot of possible improvements that can be made on this project, most notably improving the connection between the MSPM0 and the Arduino, because currently the AT command was cause problems with initializing the Bluetooth connection with the board. Another improvement I would make with more time is a aesthetic one in make both the car and the controller 3D printed housing to protect them and make them look better. I believe this project was a very impactful learning opportunity for me because I had to learn things that weren’t covered in class such as AT commands, digging really deep into serial port, and working with multiple BLE modules in tandem. I enjoyed this project even though it was grueling and hard, and I feel like I have become a better embedded engineer and student because of it.
